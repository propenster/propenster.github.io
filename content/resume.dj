# Resume

I'm Faith Olusegun

Welcome to my resume!

It has two parts, my [Professional Experience](#Professional-Experience) and [Open-Source Contributions and Projects](#Open-Source-Contributions-and-Projects).

The resume is available as [.html](/resume.html) and [.pdf](/resume.pdf).

## Narrative

I am a **Software Engineer** with a passion for building high-performance, scalable systems and modernizing legacy infrastructure. With expertise in **Java/Spring Boot, C#/.NET, Python and cloud technologies**, I thrive in fintech and bioinformatics, blending technical know-how with problem-solving skills.  

By day, I optimize transaction systems and create secure APIs; by night, I contribute to open-source projects and geek out over Rust, LLMs, and compiler design.  

Oh, and I love teaching! Check out my [YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/c/FaithOlusegun) for programming tutorials, or dive into my code on [GitHub](https://github.com/propenster).  

*"Crafting scalable enterprise software solutions and turning legacy systems into lightning-fast solutions—one line of code at a time."*
