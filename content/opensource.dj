researcher anywhere in the world. With debigenic, you do no not need to carry an office or research 
computer anywhere, just find any PC or laptop that could run docker and you have a whole virtual 
machine (container) that has everything you need for bioinformatics at least almost every tool you 
might need. It is like you could carry your bioinformatics lab everywhere and in fact share you lab with 
anyone you want irrespective of where they are.\
